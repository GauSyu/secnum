# secnum

This package provides a macro `\setsecnum` to format section numbering intuitively.

## Usage

One can simply use `\setsecnum{A,:1.i}` to set the section numbering
format as `Alph` for the sections, `arabic` for the subsections and
`arabic.roman` for the subsubsections and
the `secnumdepth` and `tocdepth` will be 3.

If one want to set the tocdepth manually,
there is an option `tocdep` for it.

One may notice that the comma `,` plays a special role in the numbering format:
for deep levels, the numbering before the comma are hided in the titles.
